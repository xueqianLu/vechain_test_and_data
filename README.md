# The Greedy Attack Against VeChain Proof of Authority

This is the repository of the paper "Lose Time, Lose Everything: The Greedy Attack against VeChain Proof of Authority". 
The repository implements the modified Vechain thor protocol and attacks shown in the paper.

The *thor* client is compiled from [thor-138d4f6](https://github.com/vechain/thor/commit/138d4f66d94327f9f3678eac89e7357f680a8dfe).
The modified client is modified from [thor-138d4f6](https://github.com/vechain/thor/commit/138d4f66d94327f9f3678eac89e7357f680a8dfe).

# Hardware dependencies
The experiments do not require particular hardware. The configuration of our computer is as follows: 16-core CPU, 32GB RAM, 500GB ROM, and a 100 Mbps bandwidth.

# Software dependencies
We ran our experiments using Docker, which can be installed following the instructions of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). The version of the Docker Engine is at v20.10.17.


# Run the Experiments Step by Step
We establish three kinds of experiments for both origin-thor and modified-thor protocol.

- xxx-1
- xxx-2
- xxx-3

In each case, we establish different validators in the testnet of both protocols.

## Build the image
```shell
./build.sh
```

## XXX-1

## XXX-2
## XXX-3


# Expected Output
The output of each experiments should looks like:
```text
```
